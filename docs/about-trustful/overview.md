# Overview

> Trustful at early stages

Trustful emerged to serve as a security layer for DAOs through reputation systems. The platform aims to transform traditional token-based voting power into a value-based approach, ushering in an era of valocracy\[external link] in decentralized governance.

Currently, Trustful is in its early development stages as an MVP. The concept recently received validation at the Zuzalu Event in Georgia, though the project remains under active development.&#x20;

At this phase, Trustful has successfully implemented one of its foundational feature—statement badges—marking the beginning of its journey toward a groundbreaking reputational era.

### Sepolia
